      <p><b>Magnolia Bakery has become just as famous for its banana pudding as those cupcakes that appeared on "Sex and the City" a decade ago. Now Magnolia Bakery is sharing its recipe for the beloved dessert so that you can enjoy it at home - even if you're nowhere near one of the bakery's seven open US locations.</b></p>

      <h2>To make Magnolia Bakery's classic banana pudding, you'll need:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>4 to 5 bananas, sliced</li>
        <li>11-ounce box of vanilla wafers (Nilla Wafers are recommended)</li>
        <li>3 cups of heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 package of instant vanilla-pudding mix (Jell-O is recommended)</li>
        <li>14 ounce can of sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups of ice-cold water</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Directions:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>To begin Magnolia's recipe, start by whisking the milk and cold water.</li>
        <li>Add the pudding mix into a separate bowl and slowly whisk in your milk-and-water mixture for about a minute, until it's smooth and lumpless.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl and refrigerate it for at least an hour. You can also just leave it overnight.</li>
        <li>Once your pudding mixture is ready, whisk your heavy cream until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>Add the pudding to your whipped cream and mix until they've fully blended.</li>
        <li>Spread the quarter of your pudding over the bottom of a bowl.(Bobbie Lloyd, Magnolia's chief baking officer, recommends using a trifle bowl or a wide glass bowl.) Add a layer of vanilla wafers and enough sliced bananas on top to cover them. Repeat twice.</li>
        <li>To finish, add one final layer of pudding and any of your additional cookies or crumbs on top.</li>
        <li>Then cover your bowl with a plastic wrap and refrgerate it for four to six hours.</li>
      </ol>
